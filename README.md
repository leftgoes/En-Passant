# En-Passant
- get all games (*my estimate from most common to least common*) on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) with

  0. the king delivering checkmate
  1. underpromoting to a bishop with mate
  2. underpromoting to a knight with mate
  3. kingside castling with mate
  4. queenside castling with mate
  5. en passant mate
    
- all pgn files from https://database.lichess.org/
- *until 2016:* under [En-Passant/data](https://github.com/leftgoes/En-Passant/tree/main/data) in .csv format
- *2017 and after:* uploaded to Google Drive due to large file size

## Format
The data is written to a .csv file seperated by ,'s.

- **number:** type of checkmate delivered
  - 0: *king*
  - 1: *qbishop*
  - 2: *qknight*
  - 3: *kcastle*
  - 4: *qcastle*
  - 5: *enpassant*
- **path:** append to 'https://lichess.org/' to get the link of the game
- **date:** UTC date of the game
- **time:** UTC time of the game
- **white**
- **black**
- **white elo**
- **black elo**
- **time control**
- **event**
- **moves:** moves in pgn format (some with clock or evaluation data)

## Data
### games.py
All of the code I used to make the diagrams is here. Parts of it are quite messy though and I'll have to clean them up in the future.
- **read:**
    - **read_games:** read the .csv file
    - **read_log:** read the log file
- **p_ratings:** probablity distribution in time interval
    - **_fit:** fit data with a gaussian
- **games_t:** number of games over time (relative or absolute)
- **games_sum:** sum of games over time
- **ratings_sum_t:** sum of rating every year over time (figures get saved in *folder* as .png files)
- **_from_year:** â†’ **_from_interval:** get the relevant data from time interval
- **_from_input:** str, int, range, list are converted to list

**Number of games between Jan 2013 and Jan 2018**

### Colors
The colors were chosen such that their inverse would be similar to the lichess color palette (*this is just because matplotlib draws a white background as default but I want it to be black*)

## Old code
[This](https://github.com/leftgoes/En-Passant/tree/main/old) is (*in my opinion more ugly*) code without OOP from July 2021. There I had only implemented en passant mates. I searched for all en passant mates until 28.02.2018
